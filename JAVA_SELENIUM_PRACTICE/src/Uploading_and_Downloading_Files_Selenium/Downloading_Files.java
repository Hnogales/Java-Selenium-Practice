	 * WebDriver has no capability to access the Download dialog boxes presented by browsers when you click on a download link or button.
	 * HOWEVER, we can bypass these dialog boxes using a seperate program called "wget".
	 * 
	 * What is Wget?
	 * 
	 * Wget is a small and easy-to-use command-line program used to automate download.
	 * 
	 * BASICALLY, we will access Wget from our WebDriver script to perform the download process.
